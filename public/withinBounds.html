This script is a module that determines if a specific property from Zillow is within a given boundary (which is approximately a square mile around a central point in ZIP 77080). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Boundary Constants**:
    - `center`: Specifies a central point with latitude and longitude, roughly corresponding to the center of ZIP code 77080.
    - `boundary`: Defines the boundary size as 0.09 degrees, which approximates a mile.
    - Using the `center` and `boundary`, the top-left (`topLeft`) and bottom-right (`bottomRight`) coordinates of the square boundary are calculated.

2. **Function `isWithinBoundary(property)`**:
    - Checks if a given property (identified by its latitude and longitude) lies within the defined square boundary.
    - Returns `true` if the property is inside the boundary and `false` otherwise.

3. **Function `fetchZillowData(zpid)`**:
    - This asynchronous function fetches property data from Zillow's API.
    - The `zpid` (Zillow Property ID) is passed as a parameter to the function to identify the specific property.
    - The function makes a GET request to the Zillow API using the provided `zpid`, including appropriate headers (like the RapidAPI key).
    - Once data is received from Zillow, the function checks if the fetched property is within the previously defined boundary using the `isWithinBoundary` function.
    - Depending on the result, it logs whether the property is inside or outside the boundary.

4. **Script Execution**:
    - Calls the `fetchZillowData` function with a sample ZPID (`80517451`), initiating the entire process of fetching the property details and checking its location relative to the boundary.

In summary, this script fetches property details from Zillow using a specified ZPID and then checks if the property is located within a predefined square boundary around the center of ZIP 77080.
