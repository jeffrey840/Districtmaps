1. **Define Four Corner Coordinates**:
    - The script defines four constant objects (`northMost`, `southMost`, `westMost`, and `eastMost`), each containing the latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lon`) coordinates that represent the four corners of a geographical boundary.

2. **Boundary Check Function (`isWithinBoundary`)**:
    - The script has a function named `isWithinBoundary` that checks if a given property is located within the defined boundary.
    - The function takes a `property` argument (expected to contain latitude and longitude) and checks whether its coordinates are within the boundary set by the four corner coordinates.
    - It returns `true` if the property is within the boundary and `false` otherwise.

3. **Data Retrieval Function (`fetchZillowData`)**:
    - This asynchronous function fetches property details from the Zillow API using the Zillow Property ID (`zpid`).
    - The function constructs the API URL using the provided `zpid`.
    - It sets the HTTP request method as 'GET' and includes headers necessary for authentication with the Zillow API (like the `X-RapidAPI-Key` and `X-RapidAPI-Host`).
    - The function makes an asynchronous request to the Zillow API to retrieve the property data.
    - Upon successfully retrieving the data, the function checks if the property is within the predefined boundary using the `isWithinBoundary` function.
    - If the property is within the boundary, it logs the property details to the console with a relevant message. Otherwise, it logs a message indicating that the property is outside the boundary.
    - If there's an error in fetching data, the script logs the error message.

4. **Actual Execution**:
    - The script has commented out lines which seem to test properties from different ZIP codes, but these are not executed because they are commented out.
    - The only active line of execution in the script fetches the data for a property with a Zillow Property ID of `28129344` and logs a message indicating it's "slightly outside the four square polygon, but in 77056 zipcode".
    - After fetching the data, the script checks if this property is within the predefined boundary and logs the result accordingly.

Overall, the script is designed to fetch property details from Zillow using their API and then determine whether the fetched property is within a predefined boundary. It showcases this functionality using a single property as an example.
