- i want you to display what teh current title is looking like  , for example if i press te for sale button i want to see that there isa looged statement that says current sold title sold

- also dinamically show me what im hovering over the price range title
display that i selected x amount when my curser is outside the input box, i also want you to log the maximum orice that i selected if it was chaged before apply and to what number , the rprice range title should also display the correct title even before the number is applied

for teh home type title , if i press select all the home type number is 0 , thsi shoudl be 2 becasue there are two property tipes , and house and town checkbox are not checkd
