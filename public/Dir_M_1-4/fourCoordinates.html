This script processes a list of latitude-longitude coordinate pairs to determine the northernmost, southernmost, westernmost, and easternmost points among them. Here's a brief description:

1. **Coordinates Array Initialization**:
    - A long string of coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude in this case) is provided.
    - The coordinates are split by space (`split(' ')`) to separate each coordinate pair.
    - The `map` function then processes each coordinate string. For each string:
        - The string is split by a comma (`split(',')`), creating an array of the three values: latitude, longitude, and altitude.
        - The three values are converted into numbers (`map(Number)`).
        - An object is created with the latitude and longitude values, and returned. This results in an array of coordinate objects.

2. **Initialization of Extremal Points**:
    - Four variables (`northMost`, `southMost`, `westMost`, `eastMost`) are initialized to the first coordinate object in the array. These will be used to keep track of the extremal (i.e., furthest in a specific direction) coordinates as the script processes each coordinate.

3. **Determining Extremal Points**:
    - The script then iterates through each coordinate object in the `coordinates` array using the `forEach` method.
    - For each coordinate object, it checks if it's further north, south, west, or east than the currently known extremal coordinates. If so, it updates the appropriate extremal variable.

4. **Console Output**:
    - Finally, the script logs the determined northernmost, southernmost, westernmost, and easternmost coordinate points to the console.

In essence, this script finds and logs the boundary coordinates of the provided set of points.
